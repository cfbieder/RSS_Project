The limited efficiency of traditional weight reduction regimens has led to a substantial increase in the use of bariatric surgery. Today, sleeve gastrectomy (SG) and Roux-en-Y-gastric bypass (RYGB) are the most used procedures. The present narrative review focuses on the risk of developing postoperative osteoporosis and summarizes some of the most relevant micronutrient deficiencies associated with RYGB and SG. Preoperatively, the dietary habits of obese individuals might lead to precipitated deficiencies in vitamin D and other nutrients affecting bone mineral metabolism. Bariatric surgery with SG or RYGB can aggravate these deficiencies. The various surgical procedures appear to affect nutrient absorption differently. Being purely restrictive, SG may particularly affect the absorption of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> and also vitamin D. In contrast, RYGB has a more profound impact on the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins and other nutrients, although both surgical methods induce only a mild protein deficiency. Despite adequate supplementation of calcium and vitamin D, osteoporosis may still occur after the surgery. This might be due to deficiencies in other micronutrients, e.g., vitamin K and zinc.

Therefore, this paper will take exercise rehabilitation to promote muscle strength and improve muscle protein synthesis as the main axis and, through integrating existing scientific evidence, discuss the special needs of chronic stroke patients in rehabilitation exercise intervention and nutrition supplement one by one. At the same time, we further evaluated the physiological mechanism of nutrition intervention to promote training adaptation and compared the effects of various nutrition supplement strategies on stroke rehabilitation.

MedDiet is characterized by the consumption of small amounts of red meat, while emphasizing the intake of fish, eggs, nuts, legumes, citrus fruits, green vegetables, olives and their derivatives, especially olive oil, and dairy products in a proportionate manner, in order to achieve the maximum health benefits. The antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective properties of these foods - both when used as an ingredient in the dietary regime or as a source of nutritional supplements - have shown promising results in the management of chronic degenerative ocular diseases, both in animal models and in human subjects. In this chapter, we will focus on the importance of MedDiet and natural compounds for the visual system and its role in slowing down age-related ocular degeneration.\nPMID:36479474 | PMC:PMC9710404 | DOI:10.15167/2421-4248/jpmh2022.63.2S3.2760",
